        <h2>Our Advocacy</h2>
        <p class="description">
            As of now, education has become a privilege. Something that’s supposedly a given right to every person has suddenly become more accessible to those who are financially well off or have the means to financially provide for it. This inequality has created a system where many people, especially young children, are denied opportunities to receive a proper education, which causes most of them to be incapable of unlocking their full potential.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Our advocacy fights for the right to quality education for every individual, regardless of their background or circumstance. We seek to challenge the inequality within the academic field head-on and plan on pushing for a change that ensures every mind, regardless of background, gender, disability, or socioeconomic status, will have access to the tools, resources, and support to unlock their full potential and achieve success.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Since the main cause of this disparity is the socioeconomic status of individuals, we aim to give more support to those who aren’t as financially well-off. However, this does not mean we will be more biased toward them. Our goal is to ensure equal opportunities for all individuals in the field of education.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Education is not, and shouldn’t be, a privilege— it is, and should be, a right. A right that can empower individuals, uplift economies, and fuel change in our society and the world. We believe that when every person is given the chance to learn, they can move forward toward a brighter, more inclusive future for all.
